/**
 * A school system needs to store information about people who are part of the school community. 
 * Every person has a name and age.
 * However, students and teachers have different additional information.
 * A student has:
 * - Student ID
 * - Grade
 * 
 * A teacher has:
 * - Employee ID
 * - Subject
 * 
 * Example:
 * Student
 * Name: Kylian Mbappé
 * Age: 17
 * Student ID: ST001
 * Grade: 11
 * 
 * Teacher:
 * Name: Cristiano Ronaldo
 * Age: 38
 * Employee ID: EMP001
 * Subject: Programming
 * 
 * Student Tasks
 * Create a parent class Person with:
 * - name
 * - age
 * - showInfo()
 * 
 * Then create class Student extends Person and class Teacher extends Person
 * Each child class should add its own properties.
 *
